This repository contains a comprehensive manual testing suite for the SOAP-based ISBN validation API (IsValidISBN10) provided by DataFlex Web Services. The objective is to test the correctness, robustness, and behavior of the service using raw XML SOAP requests in Postman.

---

📌 API Endpoint:  
The SOAP operation used in this project is accessible here:  
➡️ [IsValidISBN10 – SOAP Operation](https://webservices.daehosting.com/services/isbnservice.wso?op=IsValidISBN10)  

---

📌 Key Features:

🧪 30+ manually executed test cases using Postman:
   - Valid ISBN-10 (with and without hyphens).
   - ISBNs ending with 'X' as checksum.
   - Invalid inputs (short/long, special characters, alphabetic, alphanumeric).
   - Negative scenarios: empty, null, missing headers, malformed body.
        
  📬 Built entirely with Postman using the Desktop Agent.
  ✅ Validates response payloads and HTTP status codes (200, 400, 415, 500).
  🧾 Raw XML request bodies configured manually.
